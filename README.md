This repository contains a tmLanguage syntax highlighting file for scala twirl templates. This used to exist in Sublime Text's Package Control index, but has been removed.

NOTE: Enhancing the syntax highlighting is not a goal of mine, however pull requests are welcome! There are some issues in certain cases, but for the most part it works.
